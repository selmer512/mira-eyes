Introduction
Seeed Studio XIAO Series are diminutive development boards, sharing a similar hardware structure, where the size is literally thumb-sized. The code name "XIAO" here represents its half feature "Tiny", and the other half will be "Puissant". Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense integrates camera sensor, digital microphone and SD card supporting. Combining embedded ML computing power and photography capability, this development board can be your great tool to get started with intelligent voice and vision AI.

tip
The OV2640 camera has been discontinued, and the subsequent XIAO ESP32S3 Sense uses the OV3660 camera model.However, the Wiki example code for the camera still applies.

XIAO ESP32S3/XIAO ESP32S3 Sense Pin List

Power Pins
5V - This is 5v out from the USB port. You can also use this as a voltage input but you must have some sort of diode (schottky, signal, power) between your external power source and this pin with anode to battery, cathode to 5V pin.
3V3 - This is the regulated output from the onboard regulator. You can draw 700mA
GND - Power/data/signal ground
Strapping Pins
At each startup or reset, a chip requires some initial configuration parameters, such as in which boot mode to load the chip, voltage of flash memory, etc. These parameters are passed over via the strapping pins. After reset, the strapping pins operate as regular IO pins.

The parameters controlled by the given strapping pins at chip reset are as follows:

Chip boot mode – GPIO0 and GPIO46
VDD_SPI voltage – GPIO45
ROM messages printing – GPIO46
JTAG signal source – GPIO3
GPIO0, GPIO45, and GPIO46 are connected to the chip’s internal weak pull-up/pull-down resistors at chip reset. These resistors determine the default bit values of the strapping pins. Also, these resistors determine the bit values if the strapping pins are connected to an external high-impedance circuit.


To change the bit values, the strapping pins should be connected to external pull-down/pull-up resistances. If the ESP32-S3 is used as a device by a host MCU, the strapping pin voltage levels can also be controlled by the host MCU.

All strapping pins have latches. At system reset, the latches sample the bit values of their respective strapping pins and store them until the chip is powered down or shut down. The states of latches cannot be changed in any other way. It makes the strapping pin values available during the entire chip operation, and the pins are freed up to be used as regular IO pins after reset.

Regarding the timing requirements for the strapping pins, there are such parameters as setup time and hold time.
